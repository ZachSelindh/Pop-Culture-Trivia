# Tricky-Trivia-Game
A pop culture trivia game with Bootstrap, jQuery, and timers!

I really enjoyed making this one. You have ten seconds to click the correct answer!

These questions are rather hard, and are randomly pulled from an array every time the game loads. The reaction GIFs and their paired strings are also array elements, and will be randomly chosen whenever the player gets a question right or wrong.

When the game concludes, the player's score will be displayed, as well as a statement and GIF specially curated for their specific score.

Good luck!

I used JQuery, Bootstrap, and tons of borrowed images and GIFs for this project.
